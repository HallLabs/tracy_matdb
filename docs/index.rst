Materials Database Generator API Documentation
==============================================

`matdb` is a python package for generating databases of configurations
needed for the building of interatomic potentials. While we are
working toward a fully-automated approach, in the meantime databases
can be constructed by building an appropriate :doc:`matdbyml`. The
following links document the internal API and give some examples.

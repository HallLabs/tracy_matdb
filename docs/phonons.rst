Phonon Calculation and Plotting
===============================

Depending on the database types generated by `matdb`, it is usually
interesting to generate plots of the phonon bands to see how well the
potential performs for arbitrary displacements. We compare these to
results calculated by DFPT (which `matdb` also generates).

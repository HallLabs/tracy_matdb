 This pseudopotential is part of the Schlipf-Gygi norm-conserving 
 pseudopotential library. Its construction parameters were tuned to 
 reproduce materials of a training set with very high accuracy and 
 should be suitable as a general purpose pseudopotential to treat a 
 variety of different compounds. For details of the construction and 
 testing of the pseudopotential please refer to:
